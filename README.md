Arduino Due Makefile

This is a repository for the sole purpose of providing a working
Makefile for the Arduino Due.

There is currently not yet support for using libraries, but this
should be relatively easy to fix.

See the instructions in the top of the Makefile for how to use it.

Feedback is welcome!
